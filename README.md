### Steam API Setup
1. **Get API key**:
   Go to [Steam Web API](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) and create an API key.
2. **Find your SteamID64**:
   Use the [Steam ID Finder](https://steamidfinder.com/) to determine your profile ID.
3. **Refresh the settings in `SGL.py`**:
```python
api_key = "INSERT_API_KEY"  # API key Steam
steam_id = "INSERT_STEAMID64"  # Steam profile Id
```

### Customizing Google Sheets
1. **Create a project in Google Cloud Console**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Enable the API for Google Sheets.
2. **Create a service account**:
   - Create a service account and download the JSON key.
   - Rename the key to `Google_Credentials.json` and move it to the script folder.
3. **Create a Google table**:
   - Create the table and grant the service account access with editor privileges.
   - Copy the table ID from the URL and update it in `SGL.py`:
```python
spreadsheet_id = 'INSERT_SPREADSHEET_ID'  # Google Sheet Id
range_name = 'INSERT_NAME_LIST'  # Name list of Google Sheet
```

## üéÆ Usage

### 1. Running the script
Once configured, simply run the script with a double click or through the console:
```bash
python SGL.py
```

The script will perform the following actions:
- Check/install missing libraries.
- Gather information about your Steam games.
- Update the data in Google Sheets.
- Save the cache to optimize future requests.

### 2. Result
- Your Google Sheets table will contain the following information:
  - App ID
  - Name of the game (with a link to Steam)
  - Game Time (hours)
  - Achievement Progress (%) - If the table says N/A, then the game has no achievements
  - Completion time (main story, all styles, completion)

Example of a completed table:

| App ID | Title           | Playing time (hours) | Achievements (%) | Main Story | All Styles | Completionist |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------|------------|------------|---------------|
| 440    | Team Fortress 2 | 120.5                | 50%              | 10         | 20         | 25            |
| 570    | Dota 2          | 300.0                | 0%               | N/A        | N/A        | N/A           |

---

## üìù Logging
- All actions are recorded in the `SGL_Logs.log` file.
- If errors occur, examine this file for diagnosis.

## üíæ Caching
- The cache is stored in the `SGL_Cache.json` file and contains data about previously processed games.
- If you need to update the data, simply delete the cache file before running the script.

## ‚ùó Possible problems

### Google Sheets authorization errors
- Check that the `Google_Credentials.json` file is in the script folder.
- Verify that the service account has access to the table.

### Steam API errors
- Verify that the API key you entered is correct.
- Make sure your Steam profile is public.

### Slow performance
- The script pauses between requests to comply with API limits. This is normal.
- Use the cache to speed up reruns.
